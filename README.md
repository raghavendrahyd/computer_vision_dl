# Computer Vision and Deep Learning
# =================

This repo contains my exploration of computer vision models for various application like image classification, object detection, image segmentation, image generation etc.
#### 1. CNNs [CNNS.ipynb and cnn_architectures.ipynb]: 
Built classification models through different simple CNNs as well as some famous models like LeNet, AlexNet, VGG, ResNet on Pytorch.
#### 2. Object Detection [object_detection_yolo.ipynb]:
Played around with YOLOv5 model for object detection on Pytorch.
#### 3. Auto encoders [autoencoder_n_VAE.ipynb]:
Implemented auto encoders and VAE (Variational Auto Encoder) on Pytorch.
#### 4. GANs [GANs.ipynb]:
Implemented simple GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) on Pytorch.
#### 5. Vision Transformers [vision_transformers.ipynb]:
Played around with pre-trained vision transformers on Pytorch.
#### 6. Stable Diffusion Models [CLIP_and_diffusion.ipynb and diffusion_modelling.ipynb]:
Experimented with CLIP (contrastive language-image pre-training) and Stable Diffusion Models pretrained as well as from scratch on Pytorch.
